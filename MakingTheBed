This chapter explains how to make the bed.

## Preparing for Bed Making
* Remove soiled bed linen from the bed.
* Look at the mattress pad / mattress protector to see if it is stained, torn or damaged. If it is not, straighten it and make sure the mattress and box spring are even.
* Always adjust the mattress with your leg and not with your back to avoid any injuries. If the mattress pad is stained, then replace it.
Smooth out any wrinkles.

  **Note**: Ensure you have the washed and correct size sheets and pillow covers.

## Making the bed:

1. Pull the bed a little away from the headboard.
2. Spread the bed sheet and first tuck in the bottom side of the bed.
3. Take the loose end of the sheet, about a foot from the corner at the head of the bed and pull it straight out.
4. Tuck in the free part of the corner.
5. Move to the corner, at the foot of the bed on the same side, and repeat the procedure.
6. Tightly tuck the sheet under the mattress.
7. Maitre the corners.
8. Inset the pillows into the new pillowcase and tuck in the loose ends.
9. Repeat this process for the other pillows.
10. Place the pillow on the bed with the tucked edges facing the centre and the tucked flaps on the other side of the pillows.
11. Smooth the surface of the bed and check the bedspread for evenness on both sides.
12. Push back bed towards the side of headboard in the exact position.
